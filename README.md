# Trex
This is the most easy game I ever created in my 20 year old career. Pls make sure to check it out or I will come to your home and do it myself! Trex is a very interesting game in which a dinosaur gets lost and tries to go back home but has to entangle with the obstacle's in his way. Truly brilliant!
